			<h1>Important! How to use DGX-1 GUI</h1>
			<p>Dear %name%,</p>
			<p>Your request has been approved.<br>
				<b>Request Details:</b><br>
				Task ID: %task_id%<br>
				Date: %date%<br>
				Duration: %duration% hours<br>
				Number of GPUs: %numGPUs%<br>
				Container: %container% <br>

			</p>
			<h3>
				<b>Here you will find a short instruction how to use the system.</b>
			</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>The server account is created or allocated to you.</b> <br>
					You are provided with the access to your account via ssh protocol from 
					intranet network of UAEU: <em>ssh %server_account%@dgx1-request.aa.uaeu.ac.ae</em>
					If command is run successfully, you are in the shell of your home folder.
					<br>
					<small>NB! All users are created with predefined passwords <em>123456</em>.
						If your affiliation is not a student, we recommend to change your
						password on the first access to the server using the command <em>passwd</em>
					</small> <br>
					<small>
						Windows OS users may find short instruction how to install and use  ssh client
						putty attached herewith.
					</small>


				</li>
				<li> <b>Data folder</b> <br>
					In you home directory you will find <em>dgx-data</em> folder (run <em>ls</em> 
					command in shell to see the structure). This folder is mapped to the DGX1
					server, therefore, the data you are going to use have to be uploaded into
					this folder.


				</li>
				<li><b>Task data folder</b> <br>
					For your convenience, when your request is approved by the system's admin,
					folder <em>Task_%task_id%</em> is created in <em>dgx-data</em>  directory.
					This folder will be mounted as working directory to the container, you
					requested for. Therefore, the data, specific to the task will be stored in
					the <em>/home/%server_account%/dgx-data/Task_%task_id%/ </em>
					You can start uploading your data to this folder from your computer. E.g, 
					for linux users:<br>
					<em>scp -r path_to_your_data %server_account%@dgx1-request.aa.uaeu.ac.ae:/home/%server_account%/dgx-data/Task_%task_id%/ </em>
				</li>

				<li><b>Access to the container</b> <br>
					When the container is run for you, you will be provided with the ssh access
					to its instance. To get access to the shell inside the requested container,
					you need to run the command <em>ssh -p %ssh_port% root@localhost</em> from
					the shell opened on previous step (it will be shell inside the another shell.)
					Now you can run your python scripts here.
					<br>
					The path to the data folder inside the container is <em>%docker_working_dir%</em>
				</li>
				<li><b> JUPYTER notebook</b> <br>
					All containers with supported jupyter notebook on the DGX1 server are built 
					with jupyter notebook installed and run in the background. If you want to
					run your models on the DGX1 from your browser using jupyter notebook you
					will need to forward ports to your computer.
					<ul>
						<li><em>ssh %server_account%@dgx1-request.aa.uaeu.ac.ae -L8888:localhost:%jupyter_port% -L6006:localhost:%tensorboard_port%</em>
							<br>
							<small>NB! port 8888 corresponds to the jupyter notebook, port
							6006 is allocated to the tensorboard. If you don't use tensorboard,
							you don't need to forward 6006 port.</small>
						</li>
						<li><em>ssh -p %ssh_port% root@localhost</em></li>
						<li>In you browser go to the address <em>http://localhost:8888</em></li>
						<li> In the notebook token field insert token, generated for you: <em>%jupyter_token%</em></li>
					</ul>

				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h3>
			                            We would highly appreciate it if you could help us to justify the purchase of DGX1, by  <b> acknowledging AI and Robotics
							                                    Lab of United Arab Emirates University for offering facilities such as a supercomputer DGX1 on the publication </b> that
										                                you used the results that came out of DGX1.
														                            It will help us to buy more computational facilities in the future.
																	                            </p>
